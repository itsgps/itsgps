ITSGPS I created as a Domain name (itsgps.net) many years ago in relation to a GPS project I was working on for someone, and at some point that fell through

Subsequently we registered a business name to match the domain name, Intelligent Software Group Programming Services - a bit corny...but hey it matched that I
could then use that as a programming business.
